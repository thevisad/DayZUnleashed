/*
	DZAI User-Specified Settings File
	
	Description: 	Use this file to store your preferred settings. The variables stored in this file will override DZAI's default settings in DZAI\init\dzai_config.sqf.
					
	Instructions:	Copy over the lines from DZAI\init\dzai_config.sqf containing the setting(s) that you wish to keep after each DZAI update.
					Whenever you update to a newer version of DZAI, overwrite the default DZAI_settings_override file with your edited copy.
	
	Reminder: Remember to check if anything has changed in the dzai_config.sqf file after each update to DZAI.
	
	Example: If you always want your server to have helicopters enabled with a maximum of 5 helicopters, and using the UH1H and Mi17, then the contents of this file would look like this:
	
	-------------------------(Begin Example File)-------------------------
	

	//Add your preferred settings below this line.
	
	DZAI_maxHeliPatrols = 5;									//Maximum number of active AI helicopters patrols. (Default: 0).
	DZAI_heliTypes = ["UH1H_DZ","Mi17_DZ"];						//Classnames of helicopter types to use. (Default: "UH1H_DZ").

	-------------------------(End of Example File)-------------------------

//Add your preferred settings below this line.
