/*
	Description: 	Basic tables containing AI equipment classnames and skin models used by AI units. Some settings may be overridden by map-specific configuration files in the world_classname_configs folder.
					To make changes for a specific DayZ mod, edit the appropriate config file in for the map/mod being used.

	DZAI will first load default classnames defined by default_classnames.sqf, then load the map/mod-specific file to modify default settings.

	Example: DZAI will always first load default_classnames.sqf, then if DayZ Overwatch is detected, DZAI will overwrite settings specified by chernarus\dayz_overwatch.sqf.
